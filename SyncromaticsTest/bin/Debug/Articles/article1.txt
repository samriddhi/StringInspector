Historically, Japan has received significantly less cross-border foreign direct investment (FDI) than other developed countries (Eurostat, 1999; Fukao and Murakami, 2005). However, in recent years, intensified globalization and deregulation has led to a sharp increase in cross-border M&A transactions in Japan (Moerke, 2003; Fukao and Murakami, 2005; UNCTAD, 2005). Press, media, consultants and Japanese managers seem extremely optimistic that the flow of cross-border M&A will continue to expand (Financial Times, 2005; www.eiu.com/MA_Japan). During this process, foreign companies are expected to help restructure distressed companies (Asaba, 2005). By doing so, foreign companies might play a role in the currently discussed process of converging management practices.

Despite general enthusiasm, the performance of companies following M&A transactions has been rather disappointing. In a study of 1,700 companies in the USA, Europe and Japan, Harding and Rovit (2004) quote a failure rate of 70 per cent. Among the larger cross-border M&A in Japan, a few multinational companies are already struggling with their acquisitions. In this study, we analyze one of these unsuccessful acquisitions, namely DaimlerChrysler-Mitsubishi, and compare it with the successful Renault-Nissan acquisition. In both cases a Western automobile company, French and German-American respectively, acquired a controlling stake in a distressed Japanese automobile company.

Despite several similar starting conditions, these two acquisitions developed widely divergent outcomes that suggest differences in post-acquisition integration processes. Other authors familiar with the Renault-Nissan case have also argued that success lies more in post-acquisition management than in strategic, legal or financial issues (Takarabe, 2002; Magee, 2003; Ghosn and Ries, 2005). Therefore, this study focuses on analyzing the post-acquisition integration management process.

Post-acquisition integration processes have often been described as the decisive factor in M&A success (Haspeslagh and Jemison, 1991; Pablo, 1994). Following Birkinshaw et al. (2000), we divided the post-acquisition integration process into organizational integration (task integration) and human integration (employee resistance). Whereas organizational integration deals with the operational integration of the firms, human integration analyzes the (mostly negative) reactions of employees towards M&A integration, and methods of managing these reactions.

The majority of previous studies have tried to single out and analyze only one factor within one of these two categories. As a result, findings have been mixed and sometimes even contradictory. Few studies have tried to integrate various aspects to reach a better understanding of the M&A process (eg Larsson and Finkelstein, 1999; Very and Schweiger, 2001). Birkinshaw et al. (2000) made a first attempt at a more comprehensive analysis by investigating the role of organizational and human integration in acquisitions. However, their theory was based on only three successful acquisition cases, of Swedish companies in Europe and America.

This study is unique in three aspects. First, we hope to shed some light on the under-investigated area of post-acquisition management of cross-border M&A in Japan. Second, the systematic comparison between a successful and an unsuccessful acquisition might lead to new insights unavailable when only looking at successful cases. Third, we hope to give some further insights on the relationship between human and organizational integration. Research in the area of organizational behavior, psychology and human resource management focusing on behavioral implications of M&A activity has been frequently grouped under the terms 'human integration' or 'employee reactions' (Larsson and Finkelstein, 1999; Birkinshaw et al., 2000).

Previous studies have generally found that employees react negatively to M&A. M&A activity often introduces significant change. In order to reduce cost and achieve synergies, companies usually replace existing managers, reduce the workforce and change existing management practices (Lubatkin et al., 1999). Consequently, the remaining employees tend to react to these changes with increased stress, tension and resistance (Buono and Bowditch, 1989). These dysfunctions have been associated with increased turnover of key people, diminished productivity and increased absenteeism. This harmful cycle, in turn, negatively influences the financial performance of the company (Greenwood et al., 1994; Larsson and Finkelstein, 1999).

Researchers have identified numerous reasons for employee resistance. First, a general scepticism or fear after the announcement of an M&A, also known as the 'merger syndrome', results in distrust, tension and hostility between employees and senior management (Blake and Mouton, 1985; Marks and Mirvis, 1986). Even if only very few changes are to be implemented, M&A activity has a destabilizing effect on the involved employees (Nikandrou et al., 2000). Second, differences in management styles have been found to be negatively correlated with M&A success (Datta, 1991). Third, cultural issues, both at organizational and national level, have been identified as a main success factor (Cartwright and Cooper, 1993; Morosoni et al., 1998; Amano and Suzuki, 2002). While the majority of scholars agree that organizational cultural fit positively influences integration outcomes (eg Cartwright and Cooper, 1993), they have found mixed and even contradictory results on the effects of national cultural fit (Olie, 1994; Morosoni et al., 1998). Barkema et al. (1996) argue that cross-border M&A might be more difficult, since companies have to engage in a double-layered acculturation, that is both organizational and national cultural integration.

Scholars and practitioners assume that the negative effects mentioned above can be mitigated by taking appropriate measures during the integration process. Appropriate communication and information have been widely accepted as factors for reducing stress among employees and supporting human integration (eg Schweiger and Denisi, 1991; Mikami, 2002). Schweiger and Denisi suggest that a realistic merger preview and a program of straightforward communication with employees can reduce stress and decrease dysfunction.

Discussion of participation — giving employees the opportunity to participate in the integration process — has resulted in some controversy. Shrivastava (1986) and Cartwright and Cooper (1993) argue that participation increases the acceptance of change and decreases the probability of resistance among employees of the acquired company. This facilitates human integration. On the other hand, Piske (2002), in an empirical study on cross-border M&A in Poland, found that participation had no significant effect.

Another influential factor recently discussed in the context of M&A is leadership. Sitkin and Pablo (2005) define leadership along six dimensions: personal, relational, contextual, inspirational, supportive and stewardship. All of these have to be carefully balanced to allow for smooth integration. Furthermore, the composition of the top management should be announced as soon as possible to avoid a leadership vacuum (Marks and Mirvis, 1986).
